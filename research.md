    <h3>Kokot et al. (2025) · The EGOP Flow: Local features for Continuous Index Learning
</h3>
    <p>We study a local kernel method motivated by local advances related to the EGOP. We show that under a supervised noisy manifold hypothesis, it is possible to learn functions at intrinsic dimensional rates under a suitable Wasserstein flow. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Documents/EGOP_flow_v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-print</a></p>
